# Hospital Admission App

## Description:
- A patient and a doctor are both a person. A doctor has a speciality, availability, patients list when a patient has an addmissionDate and allergies to specify.

## Functionalities:
* Person: 
    - Give it 3 constructors:  
        + Default constructor
        + No args constructor
        + Parameterized Constructor

* We want to display the patient's data when a doctor asks for it.
* Check the doctor's availability before assigning a patient to him/her.


## Goals:
